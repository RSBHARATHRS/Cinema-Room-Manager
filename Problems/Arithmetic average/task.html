 <body>
  <p>Write a program that reads two numbers <span class="math-tex">\( a \)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\( b \)</span> from the keyboard and calculates and outputs to the console the arithmetic average of all numbers from the interval <span class="math-tex">\( [a; b] \)</span>, which are divisible by <span class="math-tex">\( 3 \)</span>.</p> 
  <p>In the example below, the arithmetic average is calculated for the numbers on the interval <span class="math-tex">\( [-5; 12] \)</span>. Total numbers divisible by <span class="math-tex">\( 3 \)</span> on this interval <span class="math-tex">\( 6 \)</span>: <span class="math-tex">\( -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 \)</span>. Their arithmetic average equals to <span class="math-tex">\( 4.5 \)</span></p> 
  <p>The program input contains intervals, which always contain at least one number, which is divisible by <span class="math-tex">\( 3 \)</span>.</p> 
  <p>Remember that int type cannot contain fractions. Use double variable to store the precise result of the division.</p>
